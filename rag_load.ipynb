The biggest concern is safety. That brings us to the main reason for \\nthe hours-of-service regulations – to keep fatigued drivers off the public roadways. \\nThese regulations put limits in place for when and how long you may drive, to \\nensure that you stay awake and alert while driving, and on a continuing basi s to \\nhelp reduce the possibility of driver fatigue. \\nThe hours-of-service regulations are found in Part 395 of the Federal Motor  \\nCarrier Safety Regulations. Thes e regulations are developed and enforced by th e \\nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Admin istration, which is par t of the United States Department of \\nTransportation. (States may have identical or similar regulations, as we will explain later.) \\n\\t\\n\\t\\nWho Must Comply With the Hours-of-Service Regulations? \\n\\t\\nYou must follow the hours-of-service regulations if you drive a commercial motor vehicle. Just what \\nis a commercial motor vehicle? \\n\\t\\nIn general it is a truck, or truck-tractor with a trailer, that is involved in interstate commerce and: \\n\\t\\n• Weighs (including any load) 10,001 pounds (4,536 kg) or more, or \\n• Has a gross vehicle weight rating or gross combination weight rating of 10,001 pounds (4,536 kg) \\nor more, or \\n• Is transporting haza rdous materials in a quantity requiring placards. \\n\\t\\nWe will describe these terms in greater detail in the next sections of this document. \\n\\t\\n**NOTE** There are exceptions to certain hours-of-service requirements for some operations. \\nThese will be covered later in this section. \\n\\t\\n**NOTE** Be aware that we are only talking here about the hours-of-service regulations. For other \\nareas of Federal regulation, the definition of commercial motor vehicle will vary, for example drug \\nand alcohol regulations and commercial driver’s license (CDL) requirements. \\n\\t\\nInterstate/Intrastate Commerce \\nTo help you understand the definition of a commercial motor vehicle, \\nlet’s talk about the meanings of interstate commerce and intrastate \\ncommerce. Comme rce deals with buying and se lling good s and \\nservices. It also deals with moving those goods from place to place \\nor going somewhere to perform the service. Basically any work done \\nin support of a business is considered to be commerce. \\n\\t\\nInterstate commerce occurs when the shipper intends to have cargo \\ntransported to another Stat e or country. That cargo is in interstate commerce from the moment it \\nleaves that shipper until it arrives at its destination. If your truck hau ls that cargo, even within a \\nsingle State, that transportation is considered to be in interstate commerce. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/driver_hos.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='Interstate Truck Driver’s Guide to Hours of Service \\n2 \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nIf you operate in interstate commerce once in a while, you are not required to comply with the \\nFederal hours-of-service regulations all of the time. You must follow the Federal hours-of-service \\nregulations while you are operating in interstate commerce. At the point you start driving in \\ninterstate commerce you must have logs with you for your last 7 days (unless you were not required \\nto log). \\n\\t\\nYou must also follow the Federal hours-of-service regulations for a short period of time after you \\nfinish operating in interstate commerce. If you were using the 60-hour/7-day schedule, you must \\nfollow the Federal hours-of-service regulations for the next 7 days after you finish operating in \\ninterstate commerce. If you were using the 70-hour/8-day schedule, you must follow the Federal \\nhours-of-service regulations for the next 8 days after you finish operating in interstate commerce. \\n\\t\\nIntrastate commerce means transportation not covered by the definition of interstate commerce. \\nUsually (but not always) that means the cargo stays, or the services occur, within a single State. \\n\\t\\nIf you are operating in intrastate commerce only, the Federal hours-of-service regulations do not \\napply to you. However, most States have regulations that are similar or identical to the Federal \\nregulations. To determine what State safety requirements you must follow, you should contact the \\nappropriate State agency. This is usually the State police, highway patrol, or an office within the \\nState’s department of transportation. \\n\\t\\nSometimes your truck may be empty. In these cases your truck is still considered to be in commerce \\nbecause it is being used to support a business. Even if it is empty, you are considered to be operating \\nin interstate commerce if you go outside of your State or remain within your State but recently \\ncarried cargo that was being transported in interstate commerce. If the truck is empty and you are \\noperating inside your State, you are operating in intrastate commerce, provided you did not recently \\ncarry cargo that was being transported in interstate commerce. \\n\\t\\nPersonal Use of a Commercial Motor Vehicle \\nIt is possible that occasionally you may not use a truck in commerce at all. You may be moving your \\npersonal belongings to a new house or, as a hobby, you may be taking your horses to a horse show. \\nAs long as the activity is not in support of a business, the Federal hours-of-service regulations do \\nnot apply to you. \\n\\t\\nIf you are not operating your truck in commerce, you are not subject to the hours-of-service \\nregulations. \\n\\t\\nWeight Ratings \\nA vehicle can be a commercial motor vehicle \\nbased on what it actually weighs or on what its \\nweight rating is, whichever is greater. \\n\\t\\nTo find the gross vehicle weight rating of a truck \\nor tractor, open the driver’s door and look for a \\nplate on the door frame. In some models, the plate \\nmight be inside the glove box. To find the gross \\nweight rating of a towed unit, look for a plate on \\nthe front of the trailer. If the trailer has a tongue, the plate might be on the tongue of the trailer. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/driver_hos.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='Interstate Truck Driver’s Guide to Hours of Service \\n3 \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nY our truck may have a gross combination weight rating (GCWR) posted in the same manner as the \\ngross vehicle weight rating. If it does not, to figure the GCWR, add the gross vehicle weight ratings \\n(GVWR) or gross vehicle weights, of the power unit and towed unit, that provides the highest value. \\nNOTE: The GCWR of a power unit is only applicable when it is towing another unit. \\n\\t\\nAir Miles and Statute Miles \\nIn the short-haul exceptions to the hours-of-service regulations, you will see the term “air miles.” \\nThis is a different measurement of a mile than what is used for statute miles on a roadmap. \\n\\t\\nAn air mile is longer than a statute mile. There are 6,076 feet in an air mile and 5,280 feet in a statute \\nmile. One-hundred air miles is equal to 115.08 statute miles. \\n\\t\\nTherefore, a 100 air-mile radius from your work reporting location can be figured as 115.08 statute, \\nor “roadmap,” miles (185.2 km) from your work reporting location. A 150 air-mile radius from your \\nwork reporting location can be figured as 172.6 statute miles (277.8 km). \\n\\t\\n\\t\\nWhat Are the Hours-of-Service Limits? \\n\\t\\nThe hours-of-service regulations focus on when and how long you are allowed to drive by placing \\nspecific limits on the amount of time you drive your truck and how many total hours you can work \\nbefore you are no longer permitted to drive a c ommercial motor vehicle. You must follow three \\nmaximum duty limits at all times. They are the 14-hour “driving window” limit, 11-hour driving \\nlimit, and 60-hour/7-day and 70-hour/8-day duty limits. \\n\\t\\n14-Hour Driving Window \\nThis window is usually thought of as a “daily” limit even though it is not based on a 24-hour period. \\nYou are allowed a period of 14 consecutive hours in which to drive up to 11 hours after being off \\nduty for 10 or more consecutive hours. The 14-consecutive-hour driving window begins when you \\nstart any kind o f work. Once you have reached the end of this 14-consecutive-hour period, you \\ncannot drive again until you have been off duty for another 10 consecutive hours, or the equivalent \\nof at least 10 consecutive hours off duty. \\n\\t\\nYour driving is limited to the 14-consecutive-hour period even if you take some off-duty time, such \\nas a lunch break or a nap, during those 14 hours. \\n\\t\\n**NOTE** If you have a sleeper berth in your vehicle, you may be able to use it to get the required \\nrest and to extend the 14-hour limit. Sleeper-berth provisions will be discussed later in this section. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\nExample: You have had 10 continuous hours off and you come to work at 6:00 a.m. You must \\nnot drive your truck after 8:00 p.m. that evening, which is 14 hours later. You may do other work \\nafter 8:00 p.m., but you cannot do any more driving until you have taken another 10 consecutive \\nhours off, or the equivalent of at least 10 consecutive hours off duty. \\n\\t\\nThis regulation is found in Section 395.3(a)(2). '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/driver_hos.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Interstate Truck Driver’s Guide to Hours of Service \\n4 \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n11-Hour Driving Limit \\n\\t\\n \\nDuring the 14-consecutive-hour period explained above, you are \\nonly allowed to drive your truck for up to 11 total hours. Once \\nyou have driven a total of 11 hours, you have reached the driving \\nlimit and must be off duty for 10 consecutive hours (or equivalent) \\nbefore driving your truck again.\\t\\n\\t\\nExample: You have had 10 consecutive hours off. You come \\nto work at 6:00 a.m. and drive from 7:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m. \\n(7 hours driving). You take a 30-minute break as required, \\nand then can drive for another 4 hours until 6:30 p.m. You \\nmust not drive again until you have at least 10 consecutive \\nhours off duty. You may do other work after 6:30 p.m., but you \\ncannot do any more driving of a c ommercial motor vehicle \\non a public road. \\n     This regulation is found in Section 395.3(a)(3).\\t\\nThirty-Minute Rest Break \\nThe hours-of-service regulations require that if more than 8 consecutive hours have passed since \\nthe last off-duty (or sleeper-berth) period of at least half an hour, a driver must take an off-duty \\nbreak of at least 30 minutes before driving. For example, if the driver started driving immediately \\nafter coming on duty, he or she could drive for 8 c onsecutive hours, take a ha lf-hour break, and \\nthen drive another 3 hours for a total of 11 hours. In another example, this driver could drive for \\n3 hours, take a half-hour break, and then drive another 8 hours, for a total of 11 hours. Meal \\nbreaks or any other off-duty time of at least 30 minutes qualify as a break. This time does count \\nagainst the 14-hour driving window, as allowing off-duty time to extend the work day would allow \\ndrivers to drive long past the time when fatigue becomes extreme. In addition, FMCSA has \\nalso added an exception for drivers of commercial motor vehicles carrying Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 \\nexplosives to allow them to count on-duty time spent attending the commercial motor vehicle, but \\ndoing no other on-duty work, towards the break. This 30-minute break is further explained in \\ngreater detail throughout this document, particularly as it relates to the 11-hour driving rule. \\n\\t\\nFMCSA does not enforce the 30-minute rest break provision [49 CFR 395.3(a)(3)(ii)] against any \\ndriver who qualifies for either of the “short haul operations” exceptions outlined in 49 CFR 395.1(e) \\n(1) or (2). Specifically, the following drivers are not subject to the 30-minute break requirement: \\n\\t\\n(1) All drivers (CDL and non-CDL) who operate within 100 air-miles of their normal \\nwork reporting location and satisfy the time limitations and recordkeeping requirements \\nof 395.1(e)(1).\\t\\n    This exception (395.1(e)(1)) applies for any day in which a driver: \\n• Drives within a 100 air-mile radius of his/her normal work reporting location; \\n• Returns to his/her work reporting location and is released within 12 consecutive hours; and \\n• Follows the 10-hour off-duty and 11-hour driving requirements for property-carrying \\nCMVs. \\n\\t\\n(2)  Non-CDL drivers who operate within a 150 air-mile radius of the location where the \\ndriver reports for duty and satisfy the time limitations and recordkeeping requirements of \\n395.1(e)(2) are also exempt from the 30-minute rest break.

This limit is based on a 7 or 8-day period, starting at the time \\nspecified by your motor carrier for the start of a 24-hour period. \\n\\t\\nThis limit is sometimes thought of as a “weekly” limit. However, \\nthis limit is not based on a “set” week, such as Sunday through \\nSaturday. The limit is based on a “rolling” or “floating” 7-day or \\n8-day period. The oldest day’s hours drop off at the end of each day \\nwhen you calculate the total on-duty time for the past 7 or 8 days. \\nFor example, if you operate on a 70-hour/8-day schedule, the current \\nday would be the newest day of your 8-day period and the hours you \\nworked nine days ago would drop out of the calculation. \\n\\t\\nAs an example, in the table shown above, the driver has accumulated a total of 67 on-duty (driving \\nand on-duty) hours in an 8-day period. If this driver is operating on the 70-hour/8-day rule, he/she \\nwould be in compliance with the HOS rules in this example. Once the driver reaches the 70-hour \\nmark, the driver cannot drive the commercial motor vehicle until he/she has taken enough off-duty \\nhours to operate again. In this particular example, when the driver reaches the 9th day of the cycle \\n(the second Monday), the hours from Day 1 of the cycle (the first Sunday) would drop off, and the \\ndriver would then be calculating his or her hours for Days 2 through 9 (Monday–Monday). These \\nsame principles apply for the 60-hours in 7-day HOS rule as well. \\n\\t\\nYou are required to follow one of these two limits: \\n• If your company does not operate vehicles every day of the week, you are not allowed to drive \\na commercial motor vehicle after you’ve been on duty 60 hours during any 7 consecutive days. \\nOnce you reach the 60-hour limit, you will not be able to drive a c ommercial motor vehicle \\nagain until you have dropped below 60 hours for a 7-consecutive-day period. You may do other \\nwork, but you cannot do any more driving until you are off duty enough days to get below the \\nlimit. Any other hours you work, whether they are for a motor carrier or someone else, must be \\nadded to the total. \\n• If your company does operate vehicles every day of the week, your employer may assign you \\nto the 70-hour/8-day schedule. This means that you are not a llowed to drive a c ommercial \\nmotor vehicle after you’ve been on duty 70 hours in any 8 consecutive days. Once you reach \\nthe 70-hour limit, you will not be able to drive again until you have dropped below 70 hours \\nfor an 8-consecutive-day period. You may do other work, but you cannot do any more driving \\nuntil you get below the limit. Any other hours you work, whether they are for a motor carrier \\nor someone else, must be added to the total. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/driver_hos.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='Interstate Truck Driver’s Guide to Hours of Service \\n6 \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n34-Hour Restart \\nThe hours-of-service regulations allow you to “restart” your 60- or 70-hour clock calculations \\nby taking 34 or more consecutive hours off duty (or in the sleeper berth) or some combination \\nof both. After you have taken at least 34 consecutive hours off duty, you have the full 60 or 70 \\nhours available again. The use of a “valid” 34-hour restart resets a driver’s “weekly” hours back \\nto zero. In addition, an individual may perform other on-duty tasks, such as loading or unloading \\nand paperwork, after reaching the 60/7 or 70/8 hour limits. They simply may not legally drive a \\ncommercial motor vehicle (CMV) on a public road when the limit has been reached. The 34-hour \\nrestart is an optional, not a mandatory regulatory provision. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\nExample: If you follow the 70-hour/8-day limit and work 14 hours per day for 5 days in a row, \\nyou will have been on duty for 70 hours. You would not be able drive again until you drop below \\n70 hours worked in an 8-day period. However, if your company allows you to use the 34-hour \\nrestart provision, you would have driving time available immediately after 34 consecutive hours \\noff duty. You would then begin a new period of 8 consecutive days and have 70 hours available. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\nWhat Is On-Duty Time? \\n\\t\\nThe 60-hour/7-day limit and 70-hour/8-day limit are based on how many hours you work over a \\nperiod of days. Just what kind of work is included in on-duty time? It includes all time you are \\nworking or are required to be ready to work, for any employer. It includes the following activities: \\n• All time at a plant, terminal, facility, or other property of a \\nmotor carrier or shipper, or on any public property, waiting to \\nbe dispatched, unless you have been relieved from duty by the \\nmotor carrier; \\n• All time inspecting, servicing, or conditioning any truck, \\nincluding fueling it and washing it at any time; \\n• All driving time, as defined in the term driving time; \\n• All other time in or on a commercial motor vehicle other than: (i) \\nTime spent resting in or on a parked vehicle, except as otherwise \\nprovided in Section 397.5 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \\nRegulations; (ii) Time spent resting in a sleeper berth; (iii) Up \\nto 2 hours riding in the passenger seat of a property-carrying \\nvehicle moving on the highway immediately before or after a \\nperiod of at least 8 consecutive hours in the sleeper berth; \\n• All time loading, unloading, supervising, or attending your \\ntruck; or handling paperwork for shipments; \\n• All time taking care of your truck when it is broken down; \\n• All time spent providing a breath, saliva, or urine sample for drug/ \\nalcohol testing, including travel to and from the collection site; '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/driver_hos.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='Interstate Truck Driver’s Guide to Hours of Service \\n7 \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n• All time spent doing any other work for a motor carrier, including \\ngiving or receiving training and driving a company car; and \\n• All time spent doing paid work for anyone who is not a motor \\ncarrier, such as a part-time job at a local restaurant. \\nThe bottom line is that on-duty time includes all time you are working \\nfor a motor carrier, whether paid or not, and all time you are doing \\npaid work for anyone else. \\nThe definition of on-duty time is found in Section 395.2. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\nOn-Duty Time In a Commercial Motor Vehicle \\nThe Federal M otor Carrier Safety A dministration (FMCSA) excludes from the definition of \\non-duty time any time resting in a parked commercial motor vehicle. Also excluded is up to 2 \\nhours in the passenger seat of a moving commercial motor vehicle, immediately before or after 8 \\nconsecutive hours in the sleeper berth. This rule continues to require drivers to take 8 consecutive \\nhours in the sleeper berth, and allows them to take an additional 2 hours in the passenger seat \\nwhen the vehicle is moving, without artificially confining them to the sleeper berth for the entire \\n10-hour period. This provides team drivers an opportunity to “keep the truck moving” by having \\ndriver A drive for 10 hours (not consecutively with a 30-minute break required at the 8th  hour) \\nwhile driver B obtains a full daily rest period without having to stay in the sleeper berth for 10 \\nstraight hours. Driver B can take 8 hours in the sleeper berth and 2 hours in the passenger seat to \\naccomplish the r equired off-duty period. Then the drivers m ay change positions and keep the \\ntruck moving. This reversal pattern could continue until either driver reaches the maximum limit \\nof 60 or 70 hours on duty in any 7 or 8 day period. It bears noting that only the first 2 hours in \\nthe passenger seat of the commercial motor vehicle c an be combined with the 8 hours in the \\nsleeper berth to get the required 10 consecutive hours off-duty. Any hours spent in the passenger \\nseat after these 2 hours count – and are properly logged as – on-duty (not driving) time. \\n\\t\\nTravel Time \\n“Travel time” refers to the time you are being transported to a new location as part of your job, \\nwhile not performing any driving on the trip. Any travel time you do at the direction of your motor \\ncarrier is considered on-duty time. However, if you take at least 10 consecutive hours off duty once \\nyou get to your destination, you may count all of the time, including the travel time, as off-duty. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\nExample: Your company sends you on a bus for 8 hours to pick up a truck and drive it back. \\nYou are simply riding the bus and not doing any other work for your company. Before driving \\nthe truck you take 10 consecutive hours off duty. In this case you may count all of the travel \\ntime as off duty as well. \\n\\t\\nThe regulation on travel time is found in Section 395.1(j). '),\n",

In order for time \\nto be considered off-duty, you must be relieved of all duty and \\nresponsibility for performing work. You must be free to pursue \\nactivities of your own choosing. \\n\\t\\nIf you are not doing any work (paid or unpaid) for a motor carrier, \\nand you are not doing any paid work for anyone else, you may \\nrecord the time as off-duty time. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\nWhat Is the Adverse Driving Conditions Exception? \\n\\t\\nIf unexpected adverse driving conditions slow you \\ndown, you may drive up to 2 extra hours to complete \\nwhat could have been driven in normal conditions. \\nThis means you could drive for up to 13 hours, which \\nis 2 hours more than allowed under normal conditions. \\nAdverse driving conditions mean things that you did \\nnot know about when you started your run, like snow, \\nfog, or a shut-down of traffic due to a crash. Adverse \\ndriving conditions do not include situations that you \\nshould have known about, such as congested traffic \\nduring typical “rush hour” periods. \\n\\t\\nEven though you may drive 2 extra hours under this exception, you must not drive after the \\n14th  consecutive hour after coming on duty, and you must comply with the minimum 30-minute \\nrest break provisions. \\n\\t\\nThis regulation is found in Section 395.1(b). \\n\\t\\n\\t\\nWhat Is the Non-CDL Short-Haul Exception? \\n\\t\\nIf you drive short distances in a truck that does not require a commercial driver’s license (CDL), \\nyou might be able to use the non-CDL short-haul exception. This short-haul exception allows you \\nto extend the 14-hour driving window to 16 hours on 2 days in a 7-consecutive-day period or after \\nany 34-hour restart and does not require you to keep a logbook. FMCSA does not enforce the \\n30-minute rest break provision [49 CFR 395.3 (a)(3)(ii)] against any driver who qualifies for this \\nshort-haul exception. \\n\\t\\nYou can only use this exception if you: \\n\\t\\n• Drive a truck that is a “commercial motor vehicle” but does not require a CDL, and \\n• Work within a 150 air-mile radius (see p. 3 for explanation of “air miles”) of your normal work \\nreporting location and return there each day.

Under this exception you are not required to keep a log book, but your company must keep accurate and true time records for 6 months showing: 1) the time the driver reports for duty each day; 2) the total number of hours the driver is on duty each day; 3) the time the driver is released from duty each day; and 4) the total time for the preceding 7 days in accordance with Section 395.8(j)(2) for drivers used for the first time or intermittently. \\tIf you come under this exception you are not eligible for the 100 air-mile radius exception, 16-hour short-haul exception, or the split sleeper-berth provision. This regulation is found in Section 395.1(e)(2). \\t\\tWhat Is the 16-Hour Short-Haul Exception? \\tIf you usually come back to your work-reporting location and go home at the end of your workday, you might be able to use the 16-hour short-haul exception. This exception allows you to extend the 14-consecutive-hour driving window to 16 hours once every 7 consecutive days. In order to use this exception, you must do the following: \\t • You must return to your work reporting location that day, as well as for your last 5 duty tours. A duty tour is the period of time from when you come to work to when you leave work. It is your “workday,” the time between your off-duty periods of at least 10 consecutive hours. • You must be released from duty within 16 hours after coming on duty. • You must only use this exception once every 7 consecutive days (unless you took 34 consecutive hours off to restart a 7/8-day period). \\tYou may not use this exception if you qualify for the “Non-CDL Shor t Haul Exception” explained earlier. \\tThis regulation is found in Section 395.1(o).

You may spend time in your sleeper berth to get \\nsome, or all, of the 10 consecutive hours of off-duty \\ntime. When getting your 10 consecutive hours of \\noff-duty time, what is most important is that you do not \\ngo on duty or drive during those 10 hours. At the end \\nof the 10 consecutive hours of combined sleeper and/or \\noff-duty time, your 11-hour driving and 14-hour duty-\\nperiod limits would completely restart. \\n\\t\\n2.   You may also use the sleeper berth to extend the 14-hour limit. Any period in the sleeper \\nberth of at least 8 consecutive hours does not count as part of the 14 hours, and, therefore, \\nallows you to extend the time during which you could use your maximum 11 hours of \\ndriving. \\n\\t\\n3.   You may also use the sleeper berth in a different way to get the “equivalent of at least \\n10 consecutive hours off duty.” To do this, you must spend at least 8 consecutive hours \\n(but less than 10 consecutive hours) in the sleeper berth. This rest period will not count \\nas part of the 14 hours. A second, separate rest period must be at least 2 (but less than 10) \\nconsecutive hours long. This period may be spent in the sleeper berth, off duty, or sleeper \\nberth and off duty combined. It does count as part of the 14 hours. It does not matter which \\nrest period you take first. After you complete your second required rest period, you will \\nhave a new point on the clock from which to calculate your hours available. This new \\n“calculation point” will be at the time you completed your first required rest period. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\nExample: You come to work at 7:00 a.m. You begin driving at 10:00 a.m. and at 2:00 p.m. you \\nspend 8 hours in your sleeper berth. At 10:00 p.m. you resume driving. Those 8 hours in the \\nsleeper berth do not count as part of the 14 hours. \\n\\t\\nThis means that you only used 7 of your 14 hours so far, and your 14-hour limit gets extended \\nto 5:00 a.m. the next morning (original 9:00 p.m. limit plus 8 hours). Your driving limit is still \\n11 hours and so far you have only driven 4 hours. That means you have 7 hours of driving time \\nstill available, allowing you to drive from 10:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m. \\n\\t\\nAt 5:00 a.m. you take your second rest period, going off duty for 2 hours. That brings you to \\n7:00 a.m. '),\n",

Your new calculation point is at the end of the first rest period, \\nwhich was at 10:00 p.m. Your new 14-hour period begins at 10:00 p.m. and ends 14 hours later, \\nat noon the following day. During that new 14-hour period you are allowed 11 hours of driving. \\n\\t\\nFrom 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. you used 9 of the 14 “new” driving window hours and 7 of the \\n11 hours of driving time. Therefore you now have 5 hours of driving-window time available \\nduring which you are allowed to drive 4 hours. \\n\\t\\nBecause your 14-hour driving window ends at 12:00 noon that day, before you can drive a \\ncommercial motor vehicle again after 12:00 noon, you must have another rest period in the \\nsleeper berth of at least 8 consecutive hours (if you are using the sleeper-berth exception). After \\nthat you must again recalculate how many hours you will have available. Your new calculation \\npoint will be the end of the 2-hour off-duty period you took earlier (7:00 a.m.). \\n\\t\\n\\t\\nRemember that you are allowed to do non-driving work after the 14-hour limit is reached, just \\nno more truck driving (but the additional on-duty time would count toward your weekly 60- or \\n70-hour limit). \\n\\t\\nEach time you take one of the two required rest periods, you will need to recalculate the on-duty \\nand driving hours available. You could continue using the sleeper-berth regulation and recalculating \\nyour hours available until you have 10 consecutive hours off duty. After 10 consecutive hours off \\nduty, you have 11 hours of driving time and a 14 consecutive-hour driving window available again. \\n\\t\\nThis regulation is found in Section 395.1(g). '),\n",

You do not have to \\nfill out a log if you come under an exception. \\nLogbook exceptions will be discussed later. \\n\\t\\nEverything you write on the log must be true and correct. You must make all of your own entries \\n(unless something has been preprinted on the log). You must fill out an original and one copy of \\nyour log. \\n\\t\\nYou must account for every day on your log, even days off, unless you are covered by a logbook \\nexception on any of the days. The log must cover all 24 hours of every day. (Each 24-hour page \\nof your logbook does not have to have a grid starting at midnight; there are provisions for your \\nemployer to designate a different starting time for each 24-hour period.) \\n\\t\\nAuthorized government inspectors may check your logs at any time. You must have a log for each \\nday of the last 8 days that you were required to log (you might have been under an exception on \\nsome of those days). The current day’s log must be current to your last change of duty status. \\nInspectors check your logs to see if you have violated the hours-of-service regulations. Violations \\nof the hours-of-service regulations can result in being fined and/or placed out of service. \\n\\t\\nThis regulation is found in Section 395.8. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\nWho Must Complete a Log? \\n\\t\\nAny person who is subject to the safety regulations and drives a commercial motor vehicle as defined \\nin Section 390.5 of the Federal regulations must complete a logbook page for any day that includes \\ncommercial motor vehicle driving and for the prior 7 days (unless under an exception on some of \\nthose days).

The 100 air-mile radius exception applies for any day in which you: \\t • Drive within a 100 air-mile radius of your normal work reporting location, • Return to your work reporting location and are released within 12 consecutive hours, and • Follow all other basic hours-of-service rules including the 10-hour off-duty and 11-hour driving requirements. Your motor carrier must keep time records of the times you report for and are released from work each day, and the total hours on duty each day. You do not have to have these records in your truck. \\tThis exception is optional. For example, you and your employer may choose to use a logbook even though you are within the 100 air-mile radius, so that you do not have to be released from work within 12 hours that day. \\tThe motor carrier that employs the driver and utilizes this exception must maintain and retain for a period of 6 months accurate and true time records showing: 1) the time the driver reports for duty each day; 2) the total number of hours the driver is on duty each day; 3) the time the driver is released from duty each day; and 4) the total time for the preceding 7 days in accordance with Section 395.8(j)(2) for drivers used for the first time or intermittently. \\tThis regulation is found in Section 395.1(e)(1). \\tNon-CDL Short-Haul You are not required to fill out a log with a graph grid if you come under the non-CDL short-haul exception. The non-CDL short-haul exception applies on days when you: \\t • Drive a truck that does not require a CDL, • Work within a 150 air-mile radius (see p. 3 for explanation of “air miles”) of your normal work reporting location and return there each day. • Follow the 10-hour off duty and 11-hour driving requirements, • Do not drive after the 14th hour after coming on duty on 5 days of any period of 7 consecutive days, and • Do not drive after the 16th hour after coming on duty on 2 days of any period of 7 consecutive days. \\tYour motor carrier must keep time records of the times you report for and are released from work each day, and the total hours on duty each day. \\tThis regulation is found in Section 395.1(e)(2).

The driver’s day went like this: \\n\\t\\n• John Doe reported for work at 6:00 a.m. He helped load, checked with dispatch, and did a \\npretrip inspection. This is on-duty time.

John marked the driving time on the \\ndriving line. The time at the truck stop (½ hour) is marked on duty, not driving. \\n\\t\\n• John then drove for 2½ hours to the Baltimore terminal where he had lunch. He again recorded \\nhis driving time. After lunch he recorded his lunch time as off duty since he had instructions \\nfrom his carrier to log his lunch time as off duty and did not have any work responsibilities \\nduring this time. \\n\\t\\n• After lunch John drove for 2 more hours and stopped to make a delivery. He recorded his time \\nagain. Following the half-hour delivery stop, which he recorded as on duty, not driving, he \\nstarted driving again. \\n\\t\\n• After ½ hour of driving, John stopped, recorded his driving time, and went into the sleeper \\nberth from 4:00 p.m. to 5:45 p.m. \\n\\t\\n• At 5:45 p.m. John recorded his sleeper-berth time and began driving again. He reached \\nthe Newark terminal at 7:00 p.m., did a post-trip inspection, and finished his log and other \\npaperwork. \\n\\t\\n• He went off duty at 9:00 p.m. \\n\\t\\nNotice that John was on duty past the 14th hour since he started this driving window at 6:00 a.m. \\nThere is no problem with being on duty longer than 14 hours as long as there is no commercial \\nmotor vehicle driving time after the 14th hour.

If such a device meets the requirements of Section 395.15 of the safety regulations, it is called an Automatic On-Board Recording Device (AOBRD), and may be used in place of a paper logbook. \\tManufacturers of AOBRDs must certify that their devices meet the Section 395.15 requirements. This includes a requirement that an AOBRD must be mechanically or electronically connected to the truck to automatically record, at a minimum, engine use, road speed, miles driven, the date, and time of day. Drivers enter other information required to complete the hours-of-service records. You should discuss with your carrier whether any device on your truck used to record hours-of-service information has been certified to meet Section 395.15 requirements. \\tThe AOBRD device must be capable of displaying or printing for enforcement officers the times of duty status changes and other required information. It must also store this information for the prior 7 days. You may review Section 395.15 for additional AOBRD requirements. \\tAn AOBRD may be used without creating any paper copies of logs by transmitting the data electronically to the carrier, or it may be used to print copies of the logs that would be signed by the driver and mailed to the carrier. \\t\\tElectronic Logging Devices (ELDs) \\tAn ELD is similar to an AOBRD in that it “automatically” records much of the information that would have been written in a logbook, and makes that information available for roadside inspection by enforcement officers, as well as transmits the data to the carrier. The FMCSA now allows for the use of electronic logging devices (ELDs) for tracking hours-of-service compliance by the motor carrier industry and CMV drivers. (For many carriers and drivers, the use of ELDs will become mandatory on December 18, 2017.) More information about ELDs is available at www.fmcsa.dot.gov/ELD.   ')]"

That is \\nwhat I will review here.  \\nIf you’re trading a small account yourself, you can download or print \\nthis guide to help develop your own strategy.\\nWith a small account I have to focus on each trade giving me the biggest return with \\nthe least amount of risk. That means my quality threshold is going to be much \\nhigher than in my larger trading accounts. When I think about quality, specifically \\nthis means I have to make sure that any trade I take meets many of the following \\ncriteria- outlined here but covered in more depth below. \\n1. The stock makes sense to trade  \\n2. I have the right entry point  \\n3. I select a reasonable share size  \\n4. I manage my risk before and during the trade \\nMy process of finding stocks each morning will be to use stock scanners. I will \\nsearch for the biggest gapping stocks and the highest relative volume stocks. A \\ngap occurs when a stock opens higher than it closed the previous day. This is the \\nresult of breaking news that causes investors and traders to be willing to pay more \\nfor the stock than it was priced at during the previous trading session. Relative \\nvolume is often the result of breaking news as well. It means the stock is trading on \\nmuch higher volume than what is normal for that stock.  \\nThese are the two types of stocks that will gain the most attention among day \\ntraders. Since I’m trading in a small account, I will focus only on stocks that are \\npriced under $20. However, I will set a min price of $1.00, because trading penny \\nstocks is very risky.  \\nIn order to be consistently profitable, I will want to be trading the “obvious” setups. If \\nit’s obvious to me, it will be obvious to thousands of other traders, and that means \\nthe stock will trade in a more predictable manner. My goal will be to focus on stocks \\nthat I truly believe have the potential to gain 20-30% during a day trade. This will \\nallow me to quickly grow a small account.  \\nIn an upcoming video I’ll talk specifically about the software I’ll use for scanning, \\ncharting, and trading. This is all still To Be Determined, but I can assure you that \\nwhatever I decide on will be live streaming for Warrior Starter and Warrior Pro \\nstudents to watch.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/tech_analysis.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='I will focus on the same patterns I used when I turned $583 into $1mil, and have \\ncontinued to use everyday since crossing the $1mil mark. Pullback patterns – A \\npullback pattern is when I buy a dip. It’s sort of like “buy low sell high”, except in the \\ncontext of a day trade. I discuss these patterns extensively a part of the Warrior \\nStarter and Warrior Pro classes.  \\nThese pullback setups will occur both on the 1min and the 5min time frame. \\nHowever, these will only be appropriate on the right type of stocks to trade. So I will \\nnot apply this pullback setup to just any stock I see, but to stocks that are leading \\ngappers or leading relative volume stocks. \\nWhat patterns are you comfortable recognizing? \\nWhere will you learn about them? \\nMy share size and trade frequency limitations will be a factor of the broker I choose. \\nThis is TBD, however, I’ll most likely use the most share size I can afford. One of \\nWarren Buffet’s quotes is that \"diversification is a protection against ignorance. It \\nmakes little sense if you know what you are doing.\" In other words, when I see \\nsomething I like, I’m all in. \\nWhat share size will you trade with? With your account, how many shares can you \\nafford to trade of some recent stocks I’ve traded? \\n(Hint: watch my recaps and then look up the ticker symbols!)  \\nMy biggest challenge here will be to avoid the temptation to swing for home runs. \\nHome runs often come at the cost of base hits. I give up the base hit to go for the \\nbig trade. I won’t be able to afford that during a small account challenge. This means \\nbeing more mindful about taking profits quickly, and not holding for a big winner. I \\nwill aim for 75% accuracy with average winners being twice the size of my average \\nlosers. \\nRule 1: Risk $50 to make $100 (during the ﬁrst week)  \\nRule 2: Daily max loss at -$100 \\nRule 3: Three consecutive losers and I’m done. \\nWhat rules would you use to trade and mitigate risk? \\nHow will you enforce them and keep track of them? \\nIt\\'s extremely important when trading in a small account to be in the moment each \\nday. That means accepting the current strength or weakness of the market. I have \\nalways had a hard time accepting weakness in the market.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/tech_analysis.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='When looking at the Warrior Trading Gap Scanner, I like to analyze the gap \\npercentage, price, volume, and float. These are the most important criteria that help \\nme determine the best stocks to trade. For a stock to show on the Warrior Trading \\nGap Scanner, it will have to be gapping up over 5%, but I prefer to see stocks with \\nmuch bigger gaps of 20% or more. \\nI like to give priority to stocks between $1.50 - $10 because they tend to make big \\nintraday price swings of 30% or more. I will consider stocks outside of this price \\nrange as well if they meet all of the other criteria.\\xa0 \\nArguably my most important criteria is the float, which is the number of outstanding \\nshares available to trade in a stock, minus restricted shares or shares held by \\ninsiders and employees. I find it to be a very critical piece of information because it \\ntells me how much supply is available to be traded on the open market. \\nThe lower the float, the more reactive the price will be to an increase in demand, \\nwhich is why low float stocks with positive catalysts and high relative volume tend to \\nmove so sharply. I like to see floats under 10 million shares, but I may consider \\nstocks with floats of up to 50 million shares. I don’t have a minimum float--the lower, \\nthe better!\\xa0 \\nAfter reviewing the scanner data, I will look at the stock chart to identify if it is \\nstrong or weak from a technical standpoint. For example, I may look at the daily \\nchart to see if the stock is above or below its 20, 50, and 200 EMA. I like to avoid \\nstocks that are below those moving averages, but I have found that stocks above \\nthose moving averages can make for great Gap and Go trades! I also want to see a \\nstrong premarket chart that has the potential to breakout above the premarket high. \\nIf there is a premarket bullflag, that’s even better!\\xa0 \\nHow do you trade the Gap and Go Strategy? \\nOnce I have identified the stocks with the best criteria, I will create a trading plan for \\nexecuting and managing the trade. I always start by thinking about my risk and how \\nI will manage the trade if it doesn’t go in my favor. My breakout or bailout mentality \\nreally shines here because I enter every trade with the intention of seeing immediate \\nresolution in my favor. I generally would not wait longer than 5 minutes for a trade to \\nstart working. If it’s not doing what I expect shortly after I enter, I will cut the trade! \\nNot only does this help me to keep my losing trades small, but it also encourages me \\nto trade only when I’m most confident in my analysis.\\xa0 \\nGenerally, I like to enter the stock as it is crossing above the premarket high, or the \\nhigh of a premarket bull flag. These are levels that many other trades will likely be \\nwatching, and we tend to see strong increases in volume and price when they are \\ncrossed. A move through either one of those premarket levels would be my entry \\ntrigger for the trade. Once I have determined my risk and the premarket level I want \\nto use for an entry trigger, I will get my order ready to execute in my broker \\nsoftware.\\xa0 \\nFor example, in the chart below, we see two yellow trendlines. The first yellow \\ntrendline helps us identify a bull flag pattern that formed during the pre market \\nsession, and my ideal entry would be as it crosses above that line. The second \\nyellow trendline helps us identify the premarket high of $20, which I would use as an \\nentry point once the market opens and the stock crosses the level. \\nCreate a Trading Plan\\nA Great Trade'),\n",
